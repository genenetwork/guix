;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This module provides an abstract way to represent graphs and to manipulate
;;; them.  It comes with several such representations for packages,
;;; derivations, and store items.  It also provides a generic interface for
;;; exporting graphs in an external format, including a Graphviz
;;; implementation thereof.
