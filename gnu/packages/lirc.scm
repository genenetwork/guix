    (description
     "LIRC allows computers to send and receive IR signals of many commonly
used remote controls.  The most important part of LIRC is the 'lircd' daemon
that decodes IR signals received by the device drivers.  The second daemon
program 'lircmd' allows to translate IR signals to mouse movements.  The
user space applications allow you to control your computer with a remote
control: you can send X events to applications, start programs and much more
on just one button press.")
