    (description "Anthy is a Japanese input method for converting
hiragana text to mixed kana and kanji.  It is written in the C
programming language.  Anthy stores personal customizations (words it
has learned from the user's input, words the user has explicitly
added, etc.) in the ~/.anthy/ directory.  This package contains the
anthy C libraries, the cannadic and alt-cannadic kana dictionaries, as
well as command-line tools for using anthy and managing
dictionaries.")
    ;; Most of anthy is lgpl2.1+.  However, some files (e.g., from
    ;; alt-cannadic) use gpl2.  See the file "COPYING" in the anthy
    ;; source for details.
