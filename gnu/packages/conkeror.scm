    (synopsis "Keyboard focused web browser with Emacs look and feel")
    (description "Conkeror is a highly-programmable web browser based on
Mozilla XULRunner which is the base of all Mozilla products including Firefox.
Conkeror has a sophisticated keyboard system for running commands and
interacting with web page content, modelled after Emacs and Lynx.  It is
self-documenting and extensible with JavaScript.

It comes with builtin support for several Web 2.0 sites like several Google
services (Search, Gmail, Maps, Reader, etc.), Del.icio.us, Reddit, Last.fm and
YouTube.  For easier editing of form fields, it can spawn external editors.")
