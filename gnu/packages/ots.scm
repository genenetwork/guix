      "The Open Text Summarizer is a library and command-line tool for
summarizing texts.  The program reads a text and decides which sentences are
important and which are not.  OTS will create a short summary or will
highlight the main ideas in the text.

The program can either print the summarized text as plain text or HTML.  If in
HTML, the important sentences are highlighted.

The program is multi lingual and works with UTF-8 encoding.")
