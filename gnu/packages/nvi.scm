    (description
      "Vi is the original screen based text editor for Unix systems.  It is
considered the standard text editor, and is available on almost all Unix
systems.  Nvi is intended as a \"bug-for-bug compatible\" clone of the original
BSD vi editor.  As such, it doesn't have a lot of snazzy features as do some
of the other vi clones such as elvis and vim.  However, if all you want is vi,
this is the one to get.")
